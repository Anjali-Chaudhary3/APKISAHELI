                        <p>Cancer is a term used to describe a group of diseases characterized by the abnormal growth of
                            cells that can invade and damage nearby tissues and organs. There are many different types
                            of cancer, but all of them start with uncontrolled cell growth.

                            While cancer can affect both males and females, some types of cancers that only occur in
                            females, as they are specific to the female reproductive system. </p>

              <h3>Breast Cancer</h3>
              <p>Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast tissue, and it is the most common
                cancer that affects women worldwide. Breast cancer can occur at any age, but it is more commonly
                diagnosed in women over the age of 50.
                 <br>
                There are several different types of breast cancer, but the most common type is invasive ductal
                carcinoma, which starts in the milk ducts of the breast and can spread to other parts of the
                body. Other types of breast cancer include invasive lobular carcinoma, which starts in the
                milk-producing glands of the breast, and inflammatory breast cancer, which is a rare and
                aggressive form of breast cancer. Breast cancer symptoms can include the following
            <ul>
                <li>1. Lump or thickening in the breast tissue</li>
                <li>2. Changes in the size or shape of the breast</li>
                <li>3. Nipple discharge or inversion</li>
                <li>4. Skin changes or redness on the breast</li>
            </ul> <P>However, some women with breast cancer may not experience any symptoms at all.</P>

            gender, and exposure to estrogen. Lifestyle factors such as obesity, alcohol consumption, and lack
            of physical activity may also increase the risk of developing breast cancer.

              <h3>Ovarian Cancer</h3>
              <p>Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the ovaries, which are the female reproductive organs that produce eggs. It is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women and is more common in women over the age of 50.

                Symptoms of ovarian cancer may include 
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Abdominal bloating or swelling, pelvic pain</li>
                    <li>2. Feeling full quickly or having difficulty eating</li>
                    <li>3. Urinary urgency or frequency, fatigue,</li>
                    <li>4. Changes in bowel habits</li>
                </ul>
                However, these symptoms can be vague and may be caused by other conditions, which can make ovarian cancer difficult to detect in its early stages.

                    <br>
                    Ovarian cancer can be diagnosed through a combination of imaging tests, such as ultrasound or a CT scan, and blood tests that measure levels of certain proteins. A biopsy may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

              <p>Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cells of the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It is most commonly caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection.

                Symptoms of cervical cancer may include 
              
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Vaginal bleeding between periods, after sex, or after menopause</li>

                    <li>3. Pelvic pain</li>
                    <li>4. Pain during sex</li>
                </ul> However, early cervical cancer may not cause any symptoms, which is why regular cervical cancer screening is important.

                    Cervical cancer can be diagnosed through a Pap test or HPV test, which can detect abnormal cells on the cervix before they turn into cancer. If abnormal cells are detected, a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
